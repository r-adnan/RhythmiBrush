**Paint with music. Our tool adjusts brush strokes based on your song. Color shifts with melody, size with energy. A blend of art and sound.**

Put up just your pointer finger to draw on the screen. Put up your pointer and your middle to erase. Turn up your sound for a thicker brush size. 

As of now, only runs on Windows. 
Make sure Spotify is already running when you run the code.

To run, navigate to the RhythmiBrush directory and type:

`.\RhythmiBrush.bat`
